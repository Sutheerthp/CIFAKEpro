# **CIFAKEpro — Deepfake Image Detector**
### 🔍 AI-powered Fake Image Detection using CNN / Transformer Models  
**Live App:** [CIFAKEpro Streamlit](https://sutheerthp-cifakepro-apppro-qtl78f.streamlit.app/)

---

## 📌 **Overview**
CIFAKEpro is a **Deepfake Image Detection** web application that identifies whether an uploaded image is **REAL** or **FAKE** using a trained machine learning model (CNN / Vision Transformer).  
The app is built with **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**, and **Streamlit**, and is optimized for lightweight, fast processing.

This project is based on the **CIFAKE (Real vs Fake Faces) dataset**, commonly used for deepfake classification research.

## 🚀 **Features**
- 📤 Upload any image (`jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`)  
- 🧠 Model automatically preprocesses and classifies the image  
- 🔎 Output shows:
  - **Predicted Label** (REAL / FAKE)
  - **Confidence Score**
  - **Progress Bar Visualization**
- 🎨 Clean Streamlit UI  
- ⚡ Fast real-time inference  
- 🛡 Works with small image sizes (32×32, 64×64 depending on model)
